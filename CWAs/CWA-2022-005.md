# CWA-2022-005: Denial of service through predictable contract addresses

**Affected versions:** wasmd < 0.29.0<br>
**Patched versions:** wasmd 0.29.0

## Description of the bug

Before wasmd 0.29.0, the contract instantiation errored if an account already existed
at the contract address. Since contract addresses are predictable, this can be abused by
attackers who create such accounts. Doing so makes the instantiation impossible.

The attacker does not need to be the owner of the account they create.
A BaseAccount can be created e.g. by sending tokens to an address via MsgSend.
A ContinuousVestingAccount or DelayedVestingAccount can be created by sending a MsgCreateVestingAccount.

### Original report

The [original report](reports/Potential_Denial_of_Service_in_CW.pdf) [^1] was provided by Jorge and Shane from the Stargaze team.
It explains in detail how to calculate addresses of future contracts instantiations and how to block them
by sending tokens to the addresses, resulting in account creations.

### Background

The root cause of the issue was a wrong understanding of the Cosmos SDK account creation logic for module accounts.
As you can see above, any user can decide the account type of an address they obtain knowledge of, no matter if they own it or now. A BaseAccount and vesting accounts can be created by default Cosmos SDK messages. App chains can also define their custom account types which may be possible to create in a similar way.

Similar problems have occurred in other places:

- Make gamm pools override addr already exists ([osmosis-labs/osmosis#2725](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/pull/2725))
- fix: return error on existing non-interchainaccounts for generated address ([cosmos/ibc-go@02dc44e](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/commit/02dc44eb03cec3575f0cb0a4a89c576ceeac034c#diff-b7761fe9cc6fb6a0f056e120e9f22509af9c82bbc1405ec5e90f4f9433789a76R44))

This advisory was not delayed in order to protect chains affected by one of those issues.

## Patch

In [#996], wasmd introduced a change to how existing accounts are handled when a contract is instantiated.
The new logic is:

- If there is no account, create a BaseAccount
- If there is a BaseAccount, use it. See [`defaultAcceptedAccountTypes`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/blob/v0.31.0-rc2/x/wasm/keeper/keeper.go#L81) for how to customize this.
- If there is a ContinuousVestingAccount or DelayedVestingAccount, prune it. See [`accountPruner`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/blob/v0.29.0/x/wasm/keeper/keeper.go#L104) for how to customize this.
- If there is a different account type, raise an error
