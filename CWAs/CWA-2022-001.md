# CWA-2022-001: Non-deterministic GRPC queries

**Affected versions:** wasmd 0.16.x-0.23.x<br>
**Patched versions:** wasmd 0.24.0

## Description of the bug

CosmWasm allows contract developers to perform arbitrary GRPC queries. Most of those queries access state. However, there are queries that access other node specific information such as node infos or the memory pool. Performing such queries leads to non-deterministic results and as a consequence can lead to consensus failures.
